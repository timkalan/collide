# Collide: A collision simulation

A simple collision simulation, implemented in Go.

## Instructions

Clone the project, `cd` into it and run 
```
go run main.go FRAMERATE NUMBER_OF_BALLS
```
I recommend keeping the framerate at around 60 and the number of balls below 100
(for now). After the project runs, go to `http://localhost:8080` to view it.
