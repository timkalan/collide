# Collide: A collision simulation

A simple collision simulation, implemented in Go.

## Instructions

Clone the project, `cd` into it and run 
```
go run main.go FRAMERATE NUMBER_OF_BALLS
```
I recommend keeping the framerate at around 60 and the number of balls below 100
(for now). After the project runs, you can start the visualizer by running `cd visualizer` 
and then 
```
npm run dev -- --open
```
